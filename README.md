## About this project

The goal is this project is to build a service to categorize products for an e-commerce platform.<br />
The service can be consumed through an API and managed with a Dashboard.

> ðŸš€ Powered by the most up-to-date versions of .NET and Angular!

### Features

-  REST API fully documented with OpenAPI standards.
  - SwaggerUI is activated to test the API in the browser.
- Dashboard to manage the service:
  - Data visualization with charts and KPI.
  - Data management: Users and Products
- (Soon) Deep learning model for automatic categorization.

> [!TIP]
> Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/JoffreyLGT/Product-categorization/issues) to see what is currently developed.

## Developer notes

> [!NOTE]
> This section is purely a notepad for developers.


### Configuration

Configuration is done using the provided `.env` file.
- When building this service, the environment variable will be injected into the backend container and will be available to the API.
- The frontend has a compilation script called `set-env.ts` to convert the needed variables from the `.env` file into Angular's `environment.ts` files. This is a necessary step since the frontend is executed on the client's machine, environment variables are not available.

### Local database setup

- Open the project directory in your terminal and type the commands:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
cd API
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

Note: There are currently no migration saved in the project since it has yet to reach a release version.

### Generate environment files for the frontend

Since the project is configured using a `.env` file, we must generate the environment.ts file for Angular.
A script called `set-env.ts` allows that.

#### Serve the application

```shell
npm run prestart && ng serve
```

#### Build the application

```shell
npm run prebuild && ng build
```
